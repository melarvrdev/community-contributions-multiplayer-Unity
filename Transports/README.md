### Installing Community Transports

Transports can be installed with the Unity Package Manager. Please follow the instructions in the manual about [Installing a package from a Git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html). Use the following url in the package manager to add a transport:<br>
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mlapi-community-contributions.git?path=/Transports/com.mlapi.contrib.transport.\<name-of-transport\><br>
For instance the url for adding the enet transport to your project would be:<br>
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mlapi-community-contributions.git?path=/Transports/com.mlapi.contrib.transport.enet
